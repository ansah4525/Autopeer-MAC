Auto-Peer: Academic Writing Feedback Tool

Auto-Peer is a Python-based text analysis tool designed to provide automated feedback on academic writing. It mimics aspects of peer review by scanning essays, reports, or papers for common stylistic, structural, and grammatical issues. The system highlights problematic text directly, explains why it may be an issue, and suggests possible improvements â€” all in an easy-to-read, HTML-formatted output.

âœ¨ Features

Sentence & Paragraph Checks

Detects long sentences that may reduce clarity.

Flags paragraphs that are too short or too long, helping maintain balanced structure.

Word Choice & Grammar Issues

Identifies misuse of may vs. might and which vs. that.

Flags fake friends (problematic or informal words in academic writing).

Stylistic Issues

Marks lonely transitionals (e.g., However,, Therefore,) when they appear weak at the start of a paragraph.

Finds overused symbols (colons, semicolons, ampersands).

Reference & Citation Checks

Detects paragraphs lacking references across consecutive sections.
